== data import ==
- create tables ("create table lineitem (...);")
- create index (converts to column store):
CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX <index name> ON <table name>;
(e.g.) CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX lineitem_cci ON lineitem;
- download bcp utility (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2043518)
- run following in powershell:
bcp <database.schema.table> in "<datafile path>" -c -C "RAW" -h "TABLOCK" -r "0x0a" -t "|" -T -b 1048576
(e.g.) bcp tpch.dbo.LINEITEM in "C:\dataset-sf30\lineitem.tbl" -c -C "RAW" -h "TABLOCK" -r "0x0a" -t "|" -T -b 1048576
- can open multiple shell windows and run bcp commands for each table at the same time? (maybe?)

== checking data in db ==
- check cci is created:
select * from sys.indexes where object_id = OBJECT_ID('<table name>');
  --> check that "type_desc" column says "CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE"
- view row groups created:
select * from sys.column_store_row_groups where object_id = OBJECT_ID('<table name>');
  --> all/most rows should have "delta_store_hobt_id"=NULL and "state_description"=COMPRESSED (except small tables)
- view row groups in detail (physical storage):
select * from sys.dm_db_column_store_row_group_physical_stats where object_id = OBJECT_ID('<table name>');
  --> check that "total_rows" is large (>500K) and somewhat consistent


== viewing statistics/exec plan ==
- viewing exec plan (in management studio)
  --> right-click on query window, check "Include Live Query Statistics", then execute query
- viewing time/io stats
SET STATISTICS TIME, SET STATISTICS IO
  --> can also set to always show in management studio ("Query Options")
  --> will show stats in message output like this:
  
(3 rows affected)
Table 'LINEITEM'. Scan count 24, logical reads 0, physical reads 0, read-ahead reads 0, lob logical reads 23628, lob physical reads 15, lob read-ahead reads 20798.
Table 'LINEITEM'. Segment reads 1, segment skipped 285.

SQL Server Execution Times:
   CPU time = 16 ms,  elapsed time = 121 ms.
SQL Server parse and compile time: 
   CPU time = 0 ms, elapsed time = 0 ms.
   
- IO stats explanation:
  - scan count: number of scans (multiple if parallelism > 1)
  - logical reads: read off buffer pool
  - physical reads: disk read
  - read-ahead reads: pages read-ahead (prefetched into cache)

- clearing data pool/cache:
DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS;

- checking data pool/cahe:
select * from sys.dm_column_store_object_pool where object_id = OBJECT_ID('<table name>');
  --> should be empty after DBCC
